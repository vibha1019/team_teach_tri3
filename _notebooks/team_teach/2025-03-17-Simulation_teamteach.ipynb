    "- **Programs that model real-world events, systems, or processes** to analyze behavior, make predictions, or test scenarios.  \n",
    "- **Simplifications using abstraction** to focus on key elements while omitting unnecessary complexity.  \n",
    "- **Tools that often incorporate randomness or data-driven models** to explore multiple possible outcomes.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In AP CSP, simulation MCQs often involve modeling real-world systems, like robot movement or game behaviors. The goal is to complete algorithms that simulate processes or decisions, without needing to write the entire code—just filling in missing lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Approach for MCQs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Break Down the Problem**  \n",
    "   - Read the scenario carefully (e.g., robot moving on a grid).  \n",
    "   - Identify variables (position, target) and actions (move, check for obstacles).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Look for Loops and Conditions**  \n",
    "   - Loops control repetition (e.g., robot keeps moving until it reaches the target).  \n",
    "   - Conditions help the robot decide what to do (e.g., check if the path is clear).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fill in Missing Lines**  \n",
    "   - In MCQs, you'll often need to fill in missing code or choose the correct line to complete the algorithm.\n",
