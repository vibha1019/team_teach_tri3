    "- **Wikipedia:** Volunteers collaboratively create and edit content.  \n",
    "- **Waze:** Drivers share real-time traffic data to improve navigation.  \n",
    "- **GoFundMe:** People contribute small amounts of money to collectively fund larger projects.  \n",

    "- **reCAPTCHA:** Users help digitize text by verifying distorted words.  \n",

    "Citizen science is a form of crowdsourcing where **volunteers participate in scientific research** by collecting, categorizing, or analyzing data. \n",

    "- [**Zooniverse:**](https://www.zooniverse.org/) A platform where volunteers classify images for scientific projects.  \n",

    "- [**Globe at Night:**](https://globeatnight.org/) Citizens measure light pollution by observing stars.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Public datasets**\n",
    "There are multiple databases, both digital and physical, of large pools of data contributed by citizen scientists. With the Internet, more people can contribute to the data, and researchers or hobbyists can use that data in their own calculations.\n",

    "### Bias: The Dangers of Public Data\n",
    "\n",
    "While public datasets can be useful for graphing trends, new technologies and innovations, research, and more, it always runs the risk of being biased and discriminatory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data comes from people, and people carry their own inherent biases. When using data to train AI or in ML, it can produce biased results:\n",
    "- A facial recognition software was found more likely to falsely state that Asian faces had their eyes closed than those of other races\n",
    "- Facial recognition technology used by law inforcement gave false positive matches for Black and Asian faces at a higher rate than white faces because the tech was trained mainly on white faces\n",
    "- When Amazon used software to sort through resumes, those mentioning the word \"woman\" (woman's sports clubs, woman's colleges) were more likely to get discarded because the majority of past Amazon employees were male\n",
    "\n",
    "When an AI trained on a specific dataset yields biased results, it's important to stop and consider where those results may have come from."
